        <h1>Why are puppies so cute!?</h1>
        <h2>
          this article we will be looking at why puppies are so darn cute!
        </h2>
        <p>
          With their big, round eyes, button noses and large heads, puppies
          share many of the same physical characteristics as human babies. And
          likebabies, as well as kittens, teddies and many cartoon characters,
          puppies provoke in us an automatic 'cute response'. They grab our
          attention, we enjoy looking at them and, at a neural level, they
          trigger activityassociated with reward and also compassion and
          empathy.
        </p>

        <p>
          in humans, and other animals, this response is an evolved, innate
          behaviour that motivates adults to look after helpless infants, and to
          be more sensitive to their needs and feelings. It makes sense, then
          that a recent study found that puppies reach peak cuteness at eight
          weeks of age, just the time when their canine mothers leave them to
          fend for themselves.
