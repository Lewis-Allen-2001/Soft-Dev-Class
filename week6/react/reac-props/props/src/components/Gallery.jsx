        This volume includes nine of Junji Ito’s best short stories, as selected
        by the author himself and presented with accompanying notes and
        commentary. An arm peppered with tiny holes dangles from a sick girl’s
        window… After an idol hangs herself, balloons bearing the faces of their
        destined victims appear in the sky… An amateur film crew hires an
        extremely individualistic fashion model and faces a real bloody ending…
        An offering of nine fresh nightmares for the delectation of horror fans.

        Tomie Kawakami is a femme fatale with long black hair and a beauty mark
        just under her left eye. She can seduce nearly any man, and drive them
        to murder as well, even though the victim is often Tomie herself. While
        one lover seeks to keep her for himself, another grows terrified of the
        immortal succubus. But soon they realize that no matter how many times
        they kill her, the world will never be free of Tomie.
